# Documentation for SMOS toolbox
## An analysis of watermass (trans)formation from space
### Overview
The SMOS toolbox is a novel numerical model which derives information about the distribution and properties of watermasses utilising satellite date.
It does this in the following ways:

	-


### Technical Information
The code included in this repository highlights the work done at the European Space Agency in order to develop a model which computes and analyses water mass formation using satellite data.

The goals of the model are to output (trans)formation data in:

	- denisty space
	- temperature - salinity space
	- geographic space

### Methodology
